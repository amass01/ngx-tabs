# NGX-TABS - Angular6 tabs app

This project generated by `angular-cli` - angular version: `6.0.3`

## Instruction

* Please install [angular cli](angular cli) globally to be able to run the app locally
  * Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require Node 8.9 or higher, together with NPM 5.5.1 or higher.
* Run `npm install`
* Run `ng serve` to serve the app on `http://localhost:4200`

## What's in the box

* Angular6.x app, running with angular/cli.
* Added .scss support.
* Added angular/material library.
* Using Rxjs library, faking a server calls to get data.

## Randomly select default tab

There are 3 tabs, one of the requirment is:
* Random tab selection on every page load
To achieve this I used: `return (new Date()).getTime() % 3;` - which returns the current timestamp % 3 (which is always 0, 1 or 2)
